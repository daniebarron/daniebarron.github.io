        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Barron, a Theoretical Physics student at Trinity College, Dublin. 
        I have a great interest in research, having done two research projects already, and I'm looking forward to doing more research in the future. 
        My key skills are in problem solving, especially physics related problems, and Python, having done research projects related to Density Functional Theory and Natural Language Processing.
        In my free time I play Gaelic Football and guitar, and am the current <a href="https://plancks.uk/">PLANCKS</a> Captain for the <a href="https://tpsa.ie/">Theoretical Physics Students Association of Ireland</a>.</p>

            <h3>Electronic Structure Theory based on Jacobi Polynomials - Summer 2024</h3>
            <p>- I participated in a funded summer internship under Prof. Stefano Sanvito along with another student.</p>
            <p>- Worked on using a Jacobi polynomial basis in a self-consistent cycle to solve electron structure theory problems.</p>
            <p>- Created a Density Functional Theory workflow in Python using the Kohn-Sham method as a way to solve and find the observables of a system of interacting electrons.</p>
            <p>- I've uploaded code from the project to <a href="https://www.github.com/daniebarron/DFT_Jacobi_Polynomials/">my GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <h3>Natural Language Processing Project - Summer 2023</h3>
            <p>- I worked on a project with Prof. Stefano Sanvitoâ€™s Computational Spintronics Group in CRANN along with three other students.</p>
            <p>- Throughout the project, I used Python to train a MatSciBERT model on materials science research papers to be able to automatically extract a database of materials and their corresponding band gaps.</p>
            <p>- I've linked below a short presentation that I gave on the project.</p>
